# racadm_init

This code allows me to initialize iDrac cards with basic commands.

Put your config in racadm_local.conf and then, run the script without any argument to see the usage (eg: bash racadm_init.sh)

If you need more complex operations, please take a look at [python-dracclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-dracclient)

Any update and forks are welcome.
